## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to my awesome project! 🎉 This isn't just any app; it's a magical journey into the world of books, powered by some cool tech! We're talking about a personal library app where you can manage your book collection, dive into AI-powered book recommendations, and fetch nifty book details from the vast universe of Google Books. Let's get our geek on with Supabase, OpenAI, and Google Books API! 🚀

## Technologies 🛠️

## Features ✨

- **Book Management**: Add, admire, edit, and delete your precious books. It's like being the librarian of your own little digital library 📔.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: OpenAI is our genie, giving book suggestions as if by magic 🧞‍♂️.
- **Book Metadata Retrieval**: Automatically grab book details with the help of our trusty sidekick, Google Books API 🕵️‍♂️.
